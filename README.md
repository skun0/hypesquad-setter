# Discord HypeSquad Setter

After Discord removed the HypeSquad selection section from user settings, many users lost the ability to change their house.
This script provides a simple workaround by allowing you to set your HypeSquad house directly through Discord’s API.

# Features:

- Set any HypeSquad house (Bravery, Brilliance, Balance)

- Ultra-Fast

- Simple UI

- Works even after Discord removed the official option

- Easy to use and modify
